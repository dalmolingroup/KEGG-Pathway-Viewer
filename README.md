# KPV - KEGG PATHWAY VIEWER
KPV is an online tool to visualize and interact with KEGG metabolic pathways.

## What's new about this?

The network elaborated in our study contemplates protein classifications according to the AP detection algorithm,facilitating the visual identification of the most important proteins of a network (points of articulation). Additionally, our proposal provides a dynamic HTML visualizations of KEGG pathways enabling the simulation of basic operations such as
nodes removal and edge addition.

## How to access the tool?
